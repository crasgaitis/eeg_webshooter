The Spiderman EEG-Controlled Web Shooter project aims to create a functional prototype of Spiderman's iconic web shooters, controlled by EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. This project integrates mechanical design, signal processing, and neural control to allow users to operate the web shooters using brain waves. Commands will include launching the web, adjusting the length of the web, and reloading the shooter.

# Key Components

# Mechanical Design
Shooter Mechanism: Develop a mechanism for propelling the web, including the flywheel system.

Reloading Mechanism: Design and implement a system for reloading the shooter with new web projectiles.

Ball and Web Design for Release: Determine the design of the ball/web that is fired from the shooter, ensuring it is lightweight and aerodynamic.

# Neural Control
EEG Recording System: Set up an EEG system to capture brain activity signals, which will control the web shooter.

Signal Processing & Feature Engineering: Process EEG signals to extract meaningful features for user intent detection.

EEG to Commands: Translate the processed EEG data into commands such as launching the web, adjusting web length, and reloading.
